HI FOLKS ,  This represent my first Mern Stack app . I have used React for frontend , node for backend , using mongodb as database , rest is fine .<br>

### REQUIREMENT : 
you should just have node installed , as for database i am using mongodb cloud database so there is no need to configure mongo db on your local machine , and it is kind of industry trend to use cloud database so having knowledge of it is real asset ! :)
Also if you need create a sperate db for yourself , create an account here https://mlab.com/signup/<br>

### Steps to run this app 

###1.CHECK BASIC REQUIREMENT 
'node -v' and 'npm -v' (without '') should return you a version number , if you get module not installed message them you need to configure node first.<br>
###2.RUN DEVELOPERS FAVOURITE COMMAND<br> 
sudo chmod 777 -R fullstack_app/* <br>
###2.GO TO 
fullstack_app and run  'sudo npm start'  (without '').<br>



### Note : 

i am using my database credentials here which i will be removed afterward. 
The database file is present inside fullstack_app/backend/server.js please change username and password to your username and password here in case i change that afterward . 
const dbRoute ='mongodb+srv://username:password@fullstack-b53fp.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority';
